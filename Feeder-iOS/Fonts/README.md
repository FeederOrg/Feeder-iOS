#  Fonts

To build Feeder-iOS, you'll need to download a few fonts and place them in here.
I'm not sure of the legality/ethicacy of uploading the fonts here on my repo,
so I decided to just leave them out. You'll need to grab these fonts:

- [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito)

Then, place the downloaded `.ttf` files in this directory. It's easiest to simply drag
the `.ttf` file into `Fonts` directly within XCode. Make sure to add it to the `Feeder-iOS` target.
